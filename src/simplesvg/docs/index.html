        <h1>Simple SVG Qgis Plugin</h1>
        <p>
        SimpleSvg is a plugin which tries to save current map as SVG. Other then the normal SaveAsSVG in the composer, this plugin tries to keep the GIS-grouping intact:
        layers in Qgis will be layers in Inkscape, symbol classes will be groups. Objects will have ids with the layername in it, so the id's kan be used of a search in 
        the xml-view of Inkscape.
        </p>
        <p>
        The plugin uses the screen coordinates (pixel values) to set the svg coordinates.
        Before version 0.8 the plugin picked only the features that were at least touching the current map view.
        Since 0.8 there is a checkbox, which UNchecked will make the plugin just fetch ALL vector objects from all layers.
        This means that for example you can load all countries of the world, zoom in to the netherlands (aka set a sort of 'resolution' for the coordinates) and 
        then let the generate svg (at that scale) for all data in the data set.
        Be carefull though: fetching ALL data from big dataset can give other problems.
        </p>
        <p>
        It can work with 'Old Symbology' and partially with 'New Symbology' both for vector- and raster layers. A raster layer  will be saved as image and included as an image element
        with an external (to the file next to the svg).<br/>
        The plugin wil also work with layers which have 'on the fly' projection enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
        For lines and polygons it tries to save both pen and symbol style, most classifications are working.<br/>
        For Points it can only save a point as a small colored circle.

    <h2>TODO's and idea's</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> better gui with more options
            <li> use labels or names for features/objects
            <li> add help button
            <li> use of world coordinates and projection in svg (not yet used in Inkscape??)
            <li> handle 'on the fly' projection
            <li> handle polygon with holes
            <li> handle new symbology (simple symbolisation)
            <li> including advanced svg tags
            <li> use svg symbols as points
            <li> css styling?
            <li> linking xref's for styles for symbols (css?)
        </ul>
