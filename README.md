# SimpleSVG

This is a plugin for QGIS http://www.qgis.org

With this plugin you create svg for given map in QGIS which is better suited for editing in Inkscape then the svg created with QGIS itself.

More documentation can be found when you install the plugin, and press the help button there.

Every release is uploaded to the QGIS plugin repository: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/simplesvg/ but better: can be downloaded and installed from within QGIS itself.

Issues: please create an issue here on github or just mail me.

Note that for Free Software developers a kind word or message, in an email or tweet, sometimes is of more value then a beer :-)
